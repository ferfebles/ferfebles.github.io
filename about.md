In my work, I write code to manage 2K servers, 60K desktops and 450K users over 900 sites. Here I write some technical entries when I found something interesting.

Sometimes I publish personal projects on my [github page](https://github.com/ferfebles).

I wrote some older posts [here](https://testandset.wordpress.com/)
